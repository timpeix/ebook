How Developers Work

## Introduction

In an increasingly dispersed and digital world, software developers have more choice than ever. Software development practices are evolving and time to market has quickly become one of today’s greatest competitive advantages. As the software industry landscape shifts, more developers are choosing to leave outdated tools and technologies behind, opting for a more iterative and open approach, and are gaining the power to make these decisions.

![](ebook-template-01-web-resources/image/gitlab101-webcast-facebook-ad.png)

While process-driven development techniques have been successful in the past, developers are searching for a more natural evolution of software development that fosters collaboration and information sharing across the lifecycle of a project. Our findings reveal that open source tools, such as Git, are now the most preferred development tools because they easily allow for iterative and conversational workflows. We hope this report helps development teams around the world better understand how to work better together.

## Key Takeaways

1. Developers are tired of outdated systems and crave modern tools.
2. Open source tools are the most preferred.
3. Git is ranked the most important development tool.
4. The age of process-driven methodologies is ending.
5. Collaboration is critical to developer workflows.
6. Continuous integration is integral to everyday work.
7. Security remains a major concern—innersourcing helps.
8. Learning curve is the biggest challenge when it comes to adopting Git.
9. Pressure from senior management ranks at the top of the list for code being released before it’s ready.
10. Unclear direction and unrealistic deadlines are the biggest obstacles to getting work done.

## What Devs Want: New Tools

#### Developers are choosing their own tools and they’re choosing to upgrade—whether or not management approves.

## Developers are tired of outdated systems and crave modern tools.

* 81% say it’s critical for organizations to use the latest development tools
* 91% of developers prefer to use the same dev tools for work and personal projects
* 36% of developers would reject a job if they do not use the latest development tools

## More developers are choosing their own tools at work.

When it comes to choosing software development tools in the workplace, devs reign supreme. Senior leadership is selecting tools for their teams less than 20% of the time, and some developers even admit to using their own tools despite what their managers say.

\[Show graph for q. 8\]

* We have the freedom to select the tools we want to use 44%
* Lead developer 17%
* We are told to use certain tools but we use whatever we want 11%
* CTO/CIO 10%
* Other 7%
* IT director 5%
* Head of engineering 4%

## Open source tools are the most preferred.

Modern developers prefer open source for work and for personal projects. 98% of developers say they use open source tools, and 75% say at least half of their tools are open source.

* 75% say at least half of their tools are open source

## Git is ranked the most important development tool.

When looking at the tools and techniques that are most important to developers, 92% say distributed version control systems \(Git repositories\) are very or extremely important for their everyday work.

Continuus Integration Pipeline

\[show graph q. 9\]

Increased collaboration with teammates is largely considered the greatest benefit of Git.

* 79% of developers love git repositories for increased collaboration with teammates
* 59% say using a Git repository allows them to be just as efficient working remotely as being in an office setting
* After increased collaboration, accessibility, code building confidence, and improved deployment speeds are the top three reasons developers love git.

## What Devs Need: Better Workflow

#### Developers indicate the demise of Waterfall, Scrum, and Agile in support of more collaborative techniques.

### The age of process-driven methodologies is ending.

The way developers work is shifting and now less than half of modern developers are using the once-popular Waterfall, Scrum, or Agile software development methods. An emphasis on the need for collaboration and automated integration exposes developers’ desire for more natural and conversational workstyles.

* 33% prefer a combined methodology for development
* 26% still use Scrum
* 18% use Agile
* Only 2% use Waterfall

### Collaboration is critical to developer workflows.

Thanks to great advancements in technology, communication styles have changed. Old techniques born in a pre-Internet of Things \(IoT\) era require too much time for meetings and planning, and aren’t suitable for distributed teams. As the number of developers who prefer to be contacted via email or IM instead of in-person \(66%\) increases, so to does the need for instantaneous and integrated chat-tools.

63% of developers say that chat/collaboration tools \(Slack, Hipchat, etc.\) are very or extremely important to their everyday work.

### Continuous integration is integral to everyday work.

With teams racing to ship the latest feature or bug fix, they can’t afford the missteps of deploying untested code and having to revert their changes.. More than half of developers use continuous integration more than 75% of the time.

77% of developers say continuous integration \(CI\) is very or extremely important to their everyday work.

# The Future of Software Development

#### Teams that can iterate the fastest will dominate the market. But first, managers have a few critical challenges that lay ahead.

### Security remains a major concern—innersourcing helps.

Security continues to be a top concern for modern developers. The vast majority \(86%\) say security is important or extremely important to them when developing code. While there are security concerns associated with using Git, innersourcing is said to help spot security challenges.

* 39% of developers identified innersourcing as a method for uncovering security issues
* 34% say innersourcing saves time and improves team dynamics for development teams

### Learning curve is the biggest challenge sto adopting Git.

Developers struggle with the learning curve of Git. However, once adopted, 66% say Git improves their team’s workflow and 68% say it helps their team to be more productive. Managers can improve productivity by helping their team get over the initial learning curve.

\[show graph q. 16\]

### Pressure to meet a deadline ranks at the top of the list

Development teams are feeling the pressure to ship code faster. However, most teams don’t have the tools and workflows they need to support velocity and set realistic deadlines. 81% of developers admit to releasing code before it’s ready.

\[show graph q. 14\]

### Unclear direction and unrealistic deadlines are the biggest obstacles

Unclear direction and unrealistic deadlines from senior management are hindering developers’ ability to get work done. By adopting a more iterative and collaborative approach, managers can get involved in the development process earlier, helping their teams to stay focused on the right work.
